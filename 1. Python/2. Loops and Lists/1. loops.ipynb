    "# What is loop\n",
    "\n",
    "A **loop** in programming is a control structure that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly, based on a condition or a sequence. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks, processing collections of data, or performing operations until a specific condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Loops\n",
    "1. **For Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (like a list, range, or string) and executes the block of code for each element.\n",
    "2. **While Loop**: Repeats the block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.\n",
    "</br>\n",

    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Iteration**: Each repetition of the loop is called an iteration.\n",
    "- **Break**: Used to exit a loop prematurely.\n",
    "- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are powerful tools for reducing redundancy and improving code efficiency."
